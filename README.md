[@tropy](https://twitter.com/tropy) on Twitter for important announcements.
To get started, download the latest version of Tropy for your platform, check
out the [user's manual](https://docs.tropy.org) and join the discussion on the
[forums](https://forums.tropy.org).

If you are interested to work on Tropy or create your own builds, please
find more details below. Happy hacking!


## Install from Source
Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (at least the
version that ships with the current [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)
release) with [`node-gyp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) and all
its requirements for your platform. On Linux you will also need to install
the X ScreenSaver package (typically, `libxss` or `libxss-dev`).

Then clone [this repository](https://github.com/tropy/tropy.git) and run
`npm install` to install all of Tropy's dependencies.

## Creating Builds
To create a dev build for your current platform run the following scripts
in order at the root of the repository:

```bash
node scripts/make clean
node scripts/make compile
node scripts/build
```

This will create a dev build of Tropy in the `dist` folder.

## Running in Dev Mode
Alternatively, you can start Tropy in dev mode directly in the
repository, by running `npm start`.
